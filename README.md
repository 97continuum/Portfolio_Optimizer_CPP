# Portfolio_Optimizer_CPP
Solving a Portfolio Optimization Problem using C++. 

This Project involved creating a Mean Variance Optimizer Class utilizing a Conjugate Gradient Method to solve a system of linear equation for a Portfolio Optimization Problem. 

The Data for this project is stored inside the [Data/](data) folder. The Code is found within [src/](src). The C++ Portfolio Optimization implementation is found within [src/cpp/](src/cpp/). The Python code is found within [src/python/](src/python/). The C++ file generates a returns and covariance matrix stored in two CSV files inside [data/results/](data/results/) and the Python Script generates portfolio metrics and visualization plots in [src/python/](src/python/).
